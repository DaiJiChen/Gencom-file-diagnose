Theere should be at least 2 teast files per use case: 1 successful and 1 failure. 
If there are any edge cases that need to be tested, there should be additional cases testing those.
Indivduals and families should ONLY fail the use case you are testing



Individual unit testing files should be named in the format <Use Case Number><letter>.gedcom
where <Use Case Number> is the use case number and
<letter> denotes which case, <a> for the successful case, <b> for the failure, and so on for edge cases


Each case should start with a note that briefly descrives the file: success/failure/description of edge case
Identifiers for Individuals/Families should be as follows
<V/I><Use Case Number><Letter><Additional Number> where
<V/I> indicates weather it is a valid or invalid entry
<Use Case Number><Letter> are the same as in the file name
<Additional Number> is an additional number used to differentiate between individuals/families

This is to allow the contents of each unit test to be added to a master gedcom file that will be used for initial higher stage testing
